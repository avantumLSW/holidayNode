# holidayNode
A node to use the information from [holidayAPI.com](https://holidayapi.com/) within the SPSS Modeler natively.

## Usage
Whilst there is no help guide yet, I will add documentation whilst appending functionality.
Here is a quick guide for an easy start:
1. Create an account at [holidayAPI.com](https://holidayapi.com/)
    * Keep in mind you need a payed account for commercial use.
2. Install the dependencies for your SPSS Modeler Installation of python
3. Install the holidayAPI.mpe from your SPSS Modeler
4. Enter your API-key, a year (e.g. 2017) and a country from the list of countries.
    * You could check 2017 for "DE" which should give you a list of german holidays to check whether something is hindering your device from communicating with the service.
5. You are free to go.

## Dependencies
For usage please assure to have the dependencies (json and requests) installed for the python version located within your Modeler installation.
